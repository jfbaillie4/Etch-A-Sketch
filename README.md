# Etch-A-Sketch
Online Etch-A-Sketch using JS to build the canvas and draw. This was a fun project I took on based on the awesome https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101.

---------

index.html == a very basic html skeleton, that contains just the high-level elements (header, body, and links to other files) and the footer. All other elements will be built by JS based on the viewport available. 
styles.css == simple set of css styles.
scripts.js == the heart of the Etch-A-Sketch. It has two main functions; building the canvas (buildContainer and fillContainer) and allowing the user to control the drawing (Draw & keyDownFunctions). There are also a few lines for set-up (drawing the initial canvas) and adding event listeners.
